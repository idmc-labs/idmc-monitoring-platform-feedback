# idmc-monitoring-platform-feedback

Dear team,

The first beta version of the monitoring platform (V1Beta) is available at http://idmc-mm.surge.sh/ and ready for feedback.
Please feel free to test it and report bugs or additional features you would like to see there. Keep in mind that the monitoring platform will send data to the parking lot of the Helix database. From there Ali will create a short form that will be pre-filled with information from IDETECT, speeding up the data collection.

The plan is to release the first version fo the platform in March. If any feature requires more time / budget we'll have wait for V2.
